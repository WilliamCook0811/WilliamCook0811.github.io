            <h3>Eclipse RPG Toolkit</h3>          
            <p>Designed and developed a text-based RPG using object-oriented programming (OOP), focusing on game mechanics, file handling, and scalable code structure. The game features a turn-based combat system, procedural enemy generation, and dynamic inventory management. Players can equip weapons and armor strategically while battling dynamically generated enemies.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Modular OOP design for Weapons, Armor, Items, and Enemies</li>
                <li>Turn-based combat system with inventory management</li>
                <li>Procedural enemy generation based on difficulty</li>
                <li>Dynamic file handling for loading game assets</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This project enhanced my problem-solving and software design skills, deepening my expertise in Python, data science, and software engineering.</p>
